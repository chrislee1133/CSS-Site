      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>I am a web developer/designer based in Georgia, US. I graduated in 2021, from Georgia State University, and Web design and programming are some of my many passions, and I primarily enjoy experimenting with game development engines and creating content for web devices.</p>

        <h3>Design and Development</h3>
        <p>I started learning to code because I had an interest in machinery and video games, and over this journey I have learned a great deal and gained a wealth of experience with developing and designing web applications, mobile applications, and implementing algorithms, while having a strong foundation in mathematics.</p>

        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p>However, my actual best skill still lies in playing video games, and in this I am the undisputed king. (This is false). My favorite genre of games to play are RPGs and FPSs. </p>
